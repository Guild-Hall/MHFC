/**
 * QuestGoal helps making the programming for quests easier since it offers several methods that make it possible to
 * deduce if a goal has been met or is failed. This allows one goal to depend on others as it is implemented for example
 * in {@link ChainQuestGoal} or {@link ForkQuestGoal}.
 *
 * Every goal has a socket that the goal notifies about its status whenever it feels necessary but it should only do so
 * when it has changed.
 *
 * A QuestGoal can be activated and deactivated. On creation, a QuestGoal should be inactive, and when deactivated it
 * should not post any notifications to its socket. If it does nevertheless, the socket is free to throw an exception.
