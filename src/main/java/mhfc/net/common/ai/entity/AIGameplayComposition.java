	 *  So I have an idea that this will be the place where all AI methods well technically common 
	 *  graphics materials like for example : The Stomp Particles from Deviljho AI will be placed.
	 *  
	 *  This will be the class that where all common gameplay of the AI will be placed. Example 
	 *  
	 *  The Stomp Effect from Deviljho stomp. of course other monsters would use that too. so aside 
	 *  from adding some updates in the General AI's which may not be final and can cause conflicts 
	 *  soon this will be a place for this methods to avoid bad casualties...
	 *

	 *  If you have Suggestions just post issue
	 *  
	 *  @author Heltrato
	 *  
	 *  TODO: Add all the basic variations
