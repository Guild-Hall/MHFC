NEW*

 of the reasons why he is called to be the hardest. We dont want to make Tigrex to be the most shining mob here in the

[Lagiacrus]

 unstoppable mob and the untouchable since the update. So we put a little slight balance to Tigrex so that
 he may be not just the one who owns the shine for being the hardest mob in the mob. In exchange
 we also rebalance his price for being balanced to this update."
